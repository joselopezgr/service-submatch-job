⚠️ `This is a service in progress, not ready for deployment. `

This is the job service for Submatch project

Submatch is going to be my creation for the final project of the Software Engineering Apprenticeship. It is a platform that will
allow Schools and Subtitute teachers to connect with each other, improving the process of finding a substitute teacher for a class.

## Structure
The project is built using Spring Boot, and it is divided into 3 main packages:
- Domain: Contains the classes that represent the entities of the project
- Host: Contains the classes that are responsible for HTTP requests
- Adaptor: Contains the classes that are responsible for the communication with the database

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. This is a Java project, so you need to have Java installed on your machine (alternatively, you can use IntelliJ)
3. Run the project (`./gradlew bootRun`)
4. The server will be running on `http://localhost:8080`
